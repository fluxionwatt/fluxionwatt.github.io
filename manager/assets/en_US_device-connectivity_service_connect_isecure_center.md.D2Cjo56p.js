In terms of video surveillance, it allows real-time preview, storage playback, and video quality diagnosis. Access control management supports authorization, record query, and permission settings. Alarm management can receive and process information from various alarm devices and realize linkage.</p><p>The platform also features intelligent applications, including face recognition, behavior analysis, and other intelligent analysis functions, as well as data statistical analysis. Moreover, it can unify device and user management and support task scheduling.</p><p>The platform has good openness and extensibility, providing interfaces and protocols for easy integration with third-party systems, enabling on-demand addition of functions and modules. In this case, we will connect it to the ThingsPanel IoT platform to achieve richer functional integration.</p><h2 id="integration-process" tabindex="-1">Integration Process <a class="header-anchor" href="#integration-process" aria-label="Permalink to “Integration Process”">​</a></h2><h3 id="prerequisites" tabindex="-1">Prerequisites <a class="header-anchor" href="#prerequisites" aria-label="Permalink to “Prerequisites”">​</a></h3><ol><li>Get the Partner Key and Partner Secret (AKA APPKey and APPSecret) from the Operations Center of the Hikvision iSecure Center. <img src="'+n+'" alt="alt text"></li><li>Deploy ThingsPanel platform and register the iSecureCenter third-party device connectivity service in ThingsPanel. <img src="'+s+'" alt="alt text"></li></ol><h3 id="steps" tabindex="-1">Steps <a class="header-anchor" href="#steps" aria-label="Permalink to “Steps”">​</a></h3><ol><li>First, create a device template and select the registered iSecureCenter third-party device connectivity service. <img src="'+o+'" alt="alt text"></li><li>Select the registered service in Service Access. <img src="'+c+'" alt="alt text"></li><li>Add a new Access Point. <img src="'+l+'" alt="alt text"></li><li>Select the devices to add from this access point. <img src="'+d+'" alt="alt text"></li><li>Add a video player card in the dashboard, configure the device, and you can view the video. <img src="'+p+'" alt="alt text"></li></ol><h2 id="code-repository" tabindex="-1">Code Repository <a class="header-anchor" href="#code-repository" aria-label="Permalink to “Code Repository”">​</a></h2><p>This device connectivity service is an enterprise version feature.</p>',14)])])}const S=i(h,[["render",m]]);export{P as __pageData,S as default};
