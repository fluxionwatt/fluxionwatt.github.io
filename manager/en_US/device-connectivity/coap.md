# CoAP

CoAP can be accessed in the following ways:
* Use ThingsPanel Rule Engine to access and convert to standard device connectivity.
* Use a hardware gateway to access and convert to MQTT to access ThingsPanel.
* Develop a custom ThingsPanel Device Connectivity Service (plugin) to access via the service.
