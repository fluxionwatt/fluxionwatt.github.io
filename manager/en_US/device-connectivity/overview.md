# Device Connectivity Overview

## Device Connectivity Goals

Device connectivity is one of the core functions of the IoT platform. ThingsPanel supports multiple device onboarding methods, aiming to help users quickly and conveniently connect various IoT devices to the platform for data collection and management. Key achievements include:
- **Multi-protocol Support**: Supports mainstream IoT protocols (e.g., MQTT, CoAP, HTTP, Modbus), meeting the access needs of different devices.
- **Full Scenario Coverage**: Supports manual addition, batch import, addition by ID, and third-party platform integration, adapting to different scales and types of device onboarding scenarios.
- **Simplified Access Process**: Provides intuitive user interface and operation flow.
- **Efficient Device Management**: Supports batch addition, automatic addition, and scan code addition, improving device management efficiency.

## Four Ways to Connect Devices in ThingsPanel

| Access Method | Operation Workflow | Core Features | Applicable Scenarios |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Manual Add | Enter device name, select device template (template can match arbitrary protocols like MQTT, Modbus), complete device addition | Simple operation, no complex configuration, strong protocol adaptability | Small number of devices, rapid deployment of single devices |
| Batch Add | Download device template → Fill in device data → Select template to import, realizing batch device creation | Efficient and convenient, supports large-scale device batch creation | Scale device onboarding, such as adding thousands to tens of thousands of devices at once |
| Add via ID | Pre-register devices in system product management, then access via device ID (corresponds to mobile scan code addition) | Requires pre-registration, standardized access process, adapted for mobile operations | Access for pre-registered devices, scenarios requiring quick binding via mobile scan |
| Add via Third-party | Connect to third-party platforms/services, batch add devices at once, synchronize device telemetry data and support downlink control | Strong cross-platform integration capability, supports batch access and data interaction | Integrating devices from external platforms, such as migration/integration of third-party devices like China Mobile OneNet, China Telecom IoT Platform, video access platforms |
