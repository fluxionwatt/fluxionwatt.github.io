# Key Concepts

## System Structure
### Device Models (Thing Models)

- A temperature and humidity sensor might differ in manufacturer or specifications, but they are all **Temperature and Humidity Sensors**.
- The inputs for a temperature and humidity sensor are temperature, humidity, and time. The outputs are current temperature, current humidity, temperature curves, humidity curves, etc. The relationship and quantity of these inputs and outputs are deterministic.
- Therefore, we abstract the software part of the temperature and humidity sensor into a standard **Device Model** component. This component includes fixed data inputs and result outputs, serving as a standard building block in the IoT architecture.

**In the real world, a Device Model corresponds to a specific Device Type**, such as a generic Temperature and Humidity Sensor.

### Device Templates

- A Device Template includes the Device Model, protocol settings, and configuration parameters. It represents the complete software collection corresponding to a hardware device.
- When adding a device, selecting a Device Template binds all the corresponding software and configurations to that device.
- **In the real world, this corresponds more to a specific Product Model**, such as "Brand X TemperatureSensor-S001".

## Device Connectivity Methods

ThingsPanel's Device Connectivity Services and Third-Party Integration Services are key tools for device onboarding.

### Device Connectivity Service (Protocol Plugins)
- **Function**: Solves the problem of connecting devices via various protocols, enabling ThingsPanel to interact with devices using different communication standards.
- **Example**: An MQTT Connectivity Service enables ThingsPanel to communicate with MQTT devices, receiving data and sending commands. A Modbus Connectivity Service allows the platform to connect with industrial devices following the Modbus protocol for data acquisition and control.
- **Role**: Breaks down communication barriers between devices, allowing diverse device types and protocols to be unified into the platform for centralized management.

### Third-Party Device Integration Service
- **Function**: detailed way to connect devices via third-party platforms, synchronizing data from external platforms into ThingsPanel.
- **Example**: The China Mobile OneNet Integration Service allows devices on the OneNet platform to sync data to ThingsPanel, enabling unified management and monitoring of OneNet devices within ThingsPanel.
- **Role**: Expands ThingsPanel's reach, enabling integration with more third-party systems, avoiding data silos, and facilitating data fusion.

## Device Data Definitions

| Concept | Description | Example |
|------|------|------|
| **Telemetry** | Data automatically collected and sent by the device, usually to monitor status or environmental conditions. Typically read-only and sent frequently. | A temperature sensor periodically sending current temperature readings. |
| **Property** (Attribute) | Represents the configuration or state of a device. Can be read-only or read-write. Users or systems can modify writable properties to change device behavior. | An AC unit's target temperature set to 22°C; user changes this via a mobile app. |
| **Command** | Instructions sent to the device to execute specific operations. Usually a one-way interaction from server to device. | Sending a "Print" command to a printer. |
| **Event** | Signals generated by the device under specific conditions, used to notify the system of changes or exceptions. | A smoke detector sending an alarm event when smoke is detected. |
