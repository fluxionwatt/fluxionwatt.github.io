# Design Philosophy

"Great truths are always simple."
—— *Laozi*

## Design Goals
- **Simplicity**
  - Example: Adding a device requires only one menu and one button; all device onboarding processes are centralized here.
- **Speed**
  - Example: Through abstraction and encapsulation, Device Templates are formed, greatly improving reuse efficiency.

## Design Mission
- Eliminate repetitive actions.
- Reduce wasted time.
- Enhance human-centric experience.

## Design Logic
- Design the system using common sense.
- Solve complex problems with simple methods.
- Higher-level abstraction.
- Simplify the system with standardized components.

## Design Principles

### Concepts & Naming
- **MECE Principle** (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive). Independent and exhaustive, making structural divisions logically clear.

### Openness Principle
- All parallel functional items must be open and extensible. (Anywhere multiple options exist, this must be satisfied).

### Minimalism Principle
- Achieve business goals with the fewest mouse clicks.
- Achieve business goals with the least amount of code.
- Achieve objectives with minimal cognitive load.
- If possible, delete it.

### Consistency Principle
- Backward compatibility for features.
- Do not change user habits.
- Consistent interface usability style.
